In your own words discuss Binary and its impact:

    Binary is a system of encoding and recording values, using only 1's and 0's. Stored in a bit,
    the smallest unit of data available, and increase by power of two. So the first bit represents one,
    the next bit to the left is 2, then 4, then 8, then 16, then 32 and so on. Ones and zeros can 
    represent "on" or "off" respectively. Or they can be "true" or "false" and other values.
    Using this simple system, we can use various combintations of bits and values to represent numbers,
    letters, characters, colors and so on.
    All code written in any computer language is compiled and translated to be an executable file in Binary.



In your own words discuss Algorithms as was introduced:

    Any Algorithm is a set of steps or instructions to arrive at a solution. In the example of making a PB + J sandwich, 
    David Malan demonstrated that the steps need to be very specific and exact as computers have no sense of 
    interpretation. They do not make assumptions and only do exactly as commanded or programmed.
